* Make the TBF ul/dl list per BTS
* Make the SBA per BTS
* Make the tbf point to the BTS so we can kill plenty of parameters
* Group more into in classes.. remove bts pointers.
* Change functions with 100 parameters to get a struct as param
* Move move into the TBF class
* Replace trx/ts with pointers. E.g. a PDCH should know the trx
  it is on... then we can omit trx, ts and parameters and just pass
  the pdch.
* On global free/reset... also flush the timing advance..
